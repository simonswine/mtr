The "split" format is for a separating the gui from the main program.
The main program can be installed setuid, and you don't want to link a
gui-library with a setuid program.


The split format is:

<pos> <host> <loss%> <rcvd pckts> <sent pckts> <best> <avg> <worst> 


The "raw" format is:

hostline|pingline|dnsline|timestampline

hostline:
h <pos> <host IP>

pingline:
p <pos> <pingtime (ms)>

dnsline: 
d <pos> <hostname>

timestampline:
t <pos> <pingtime> <timestamp>


Timestampline is not  yet implemented. Need to find out how to do
ICMP timestamping first. :-)
